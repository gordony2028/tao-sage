## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication & Subscription Management

```typescript
// User object enhancement needed
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  subscription: {
    tier: 'free' | 'sage_plus' | 'sage_pro';
    status: 'active' | 'trial' | 'cancelled';
    consultations_used_this_week: number;
    week_reset_date: Date;
  };
}
```

### Feature Gating Strategy

```typescript
// Implementation pattern for all features
function canAccessFeature(user: User, feature: string): boolean {
  const plan = SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS[user.subscription.tier];
  return plan.limitations[feature];
}

// Usage in components
{canAccessFeature(user, 'aiInsights') && (
  <AIInsightsPanel />
)}
```

### Database Schema Priority

```sql
-- Phase 1: Essential tables
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'free',
  consultations_this_week INT DEFAULT 0,
  week_reset_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE consultations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  question TEXT,
  hexagram_number INT,
  interpretation JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Phase 2: Community and patterns
CREATE TABLE user_patterns (
  user_id UUID,
  pattern_type TEXT,
  pattern_data JSONB,
  identified_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Phase 3: Professional features
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
  user_id UUID,
  api_key TEXT,
  permissions JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Launch Strategy

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Launch

**Target**: 4-6 weeks from now

**Must-Have Features**:

- âœ… Basic hexagram generation
- âœ… Free tier with usage limits
- âœ… User authentication
- [ ] Consultation history (30 days for free)
- [ ] Sage+ subscription with unlimited consultations
- [ ] Basic AI interpretations (OpenAI)

**Nice-to-Have for Launch**:

- [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Community features
- [ ] Advanced pattern recognition

### Post-Launch Priorities (Based on User Feedback)

1. **Month 1**: Focus on Sage+ conversion features
2. **Month 2**: Community and engagement features
3. **Month 3**: Sage Pro professional features

## Risk Mitigation

### Over-Promising Features

**Risk**: Pricing page promises features we can't deliver quickly
**Mitigation**:

- Add "Coming Soon" badges to unreleased features
- Implement basic versions first, enhance over time
- Clear communication about feature timeline

### Technical Complexity

**Risk**: Advanced features (AI, calendar) are complex
**Mitigation**:

- Start with simple implementations
- Use third-party services (OpenAI, Google APIs)
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Revenue Dependency

**Risk**: Need paid features working quickly for revenue
**Mitigation**:

- Prioritize Sage+ features over Sage Pro
- Focus on unlimited consultations first (easier to implement)
- AI integration second (clear value proposition)

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success

- [ ] User can upgrade to Sage+ (even if features limited)

### Phase 2 Success

- [ ] 10%+ conversion from free to Sage+

### Phase 3 Success

- [ ] Sage Pro users getting value from advanced features
- [ ] Professional users (coaches/therapists) adopting white-label
- [ ] API usage by developers/partners
