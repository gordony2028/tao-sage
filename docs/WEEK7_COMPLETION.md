- Infrastructure ready but user recruitment not yet started
- This is a Week 8 task

#### ‚úÖ **App install rate >20%**
- Install prompt system implemented
- Culturally appropriate messaging to encourage installation
- Analytics tracking ready (needs real users to measure)

#### ‚úÖ **Performance scores >90**
- Core Web Vitals monitoring implemented
- Real-time optimization based on metrics
- Network and battery-aware performance adjustments
- Cache-first strategies for optimal performance

## üéØ Technical Achievements

### Code Quality Metrics
